# Getting Started with the Movie Nomination demo.

To start this project from this github repo, you will need to first sign up for an api key with OMDBapi at http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx.

After you sign up you will receive an email with an API key that will allow you to run this project in your local server but to do this you will first need to create a new file in the the project's directory named: ".env.local".

In this .env.local you will want to write in this file your API key in this variable in the curly brackets: 

**REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY="<API key here>"**

**Note: keep in mind to exclude the angular brackets eg. <> when inserting in the line above.

After this you will be able to run the project but going to the projects directory and running the command:

**npm start**
